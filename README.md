IO Lab Final Project

=====
Project Title
Your True Friendship Organizer 
- Who likes me the most?

=====
Project Description
Based on what we have learned from the course, we built an app to get the data from Facebook and to draw visulization showing the user's social relationship on Facebook. Facebook's interface is mainly focusing on the most recent information coming from the user's social network as shown in their News Feeds interface. However, we came to think of other elements of friendship in Facebook - Time!. This app is like a time-lapse picture of a user's friendship on facebook. 
We acquire the user's 1-year-worth of feed data from Facebook's Graph API, and aggregated the number of feeds and comments from their friends. We calculate the friendship score for top 50 friends and visualize the patterns for each quarter.
